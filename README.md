# Tempo — The easiest way to work with dates in JavaScript (and TypeScript)

Tempo is a new library in a proud tradition of JavaScript date and time libraries. Inspired by the likes of moment.js, day.js, and date-fns Tempo is built from the ground up to be as small and easy to use as possible.

Tempo is best thought of as a collection of utilities for working with `Date` objects — an important distinction from other libraries that provide custom date primitives. Under the hood, Tempo mines JavaScript's `Intl.DateTimeFormat` to extract complex data like timezones offsets and locale aware date formats giving you a simple API to format, parse, and manipulates dates.
